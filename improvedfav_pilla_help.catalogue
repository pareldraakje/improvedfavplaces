"Pilla's Improved Favourite Places"
"This is a controller to lock/unlock your favourite place icons. When unlocked, you can move the currently active metaroom's favourite places up/down. Sometimes you may have to resize your window before seeing any effects. After removing/reordering, your pgUP/pgDown keys might behave wonky for 1/2 turns, after that they'll return to normal."
